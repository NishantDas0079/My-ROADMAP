# A roadmap for becoming Full Stack Data Scientist 


I am designing my roadmap in order to learn and master the skills required for becoming a Full Stack Data Scientist :- A person who can handle entire end to end data science pipeline - From collection to engineering to Deployment. 



# Phase 1 – Core Foundations 

Objective: Get strong in programming, math, and databases.

Programming: Python (pandas, NumPy), SQL

Math: Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, Calculus basics

CS Basics:

Data Structures & Algorithms

Databases: SQL (Postgres/MySQL), NoSQL basics (MongoDB)



# Phase 2 – Data Engineering Foundations 

Objective: Learn how to handle and move big data.

ETL & Pipelines: Apache Airflow, Luigi

Big Data Tools: Hadoop, PySpark

Data Warehousing: Redshift

Streaming Data: Kafka basics

Cloud Basics: AWS S3, EC2, GCP, Azure



# Phase 3 – Data Science & ML 

Objective: Learn analysis + ML models.

Data Analysis & Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

ML with Scikit-learn:

Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA

Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)


Statistics for DS: Hypothesis testing, A/B testing

Feature Engineering: Encoding, scaling, missing values

Experimentation: Cross-validation, grid search




# Phase 4 – Advanced ML + Deep Learning

Objective: Become skilled in modern AI.

Deep Learning (PyTorch / TensorFlow):

CNNs (Computer Vision)

RNN/LSTM/GRU (Time Series, NLP)

Transformers (BERT, GPT basics)

NLP: Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, embeddings

Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection




# Phase 5 – MLOps & Deployment

Objective: Implementation of ML models.

APIs for ML: Flask / FastAPI

Containerization: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)

CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions / Jenkins

Model Deployment: AWS Sagemaker, GCP AI Platform, Azure ML

Monitoring: MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana




# Mini Projects 

Sales data analysis with SQL + Pandas

Build a pipeline: Collect data (API/web scraping) → clean → store in DB

Real-time streaming dashboard (Kafka + Spark + visualization)

Predict house prices (Regression)

Image classifier (Cats vs Dogs)

Fake news detection with Transformers

Deploy churn prediction model with Flask + Docker on AWS.
